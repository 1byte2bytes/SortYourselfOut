# SortYourselfOut
Can you sort?

Write a program that takes in a binary file containing up to millions of 32-bit signed integers and 
writes a binary file containing those integers, sorted.

Use generate.py to make a test file, and check.py to check your work.

## File format
The input file will consist of a flat binary array of `int32_t`'s. Output files should consist of a similar format.

## Submission Instructions

Please fork this repo and make a directory with your submission username.
This folder should contain, at least, a README.md containing instructions to build and run your code. 

## Runtime Info
I will be running your submissions on my machine, which as an i7-4960K, 20 GB RAM, and uses 
Fedora 26. It has GCC v7, Java 8, and Mono available. I will install additional dependencies at request
so long as they are reasonable.

I will be timing out applications that take longer than 1 minute to run on my machine on an input of ~100 MB.

Good luck!
